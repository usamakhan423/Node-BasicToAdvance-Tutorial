    <---HTTP Module--->
    Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to
    transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). To 
    include the HTTP module, use the require() method: var http = 
    require('http')
}

{
    <---HTTP Request--->
    An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located 
    on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server.
}

{
    <---HTTP POST REQUEST--->
    POST is a request method supported by HTTP used by the World Wide Web. The HTTP POST 
    method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by 
    the Content-Type header. We use Express. js in order to create a server and to make 
    requests (GET, POST, etc).
}

{
    <---Route in nodeJs--->
    Routing refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.
     For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing. You define routing using methods
      of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to
       handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests.
